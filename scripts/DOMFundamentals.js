// The DOM (Document Object Model) is a JS representation of a webpage aka a JS "window" into the content of the webpage.
// Each JS object: href, li, h1, img, ul

// The document object is our entry point into the world of the DOM. It contains representations of all page content 
// as well as useful methods and properties

// The document is considered the root of the tree of objects ( href, li, h1, img, ul)
